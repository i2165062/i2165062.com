      <h1 class="intro-title">Project i2165062</h1>
      <p class="intro-subtitle">A Vision Born from the Heart of the Middle East</p>

      <div class="intro-text">
        <p>
          <strong>i2165062</strong> is more than a digital initiative — it is a cultural bridge built from the heart of the Middle East.
          This project was born out of a desire to show the world a more honest, human, and creative image of this region — a region
          that has often been misunderstood through the lens of politics and media.
        </p>

        <p>
          At its core, <strong>i2165062</strong> celebrates the essence of four nations — <em>Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia,</em> and <em>Turkey</em> —
          each representing a distinct voice, heritage, and creative energy. Together, they form a living identity of the Middle East —
          one made of art, innovation, and resilience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal is to merge <strong>blockchain technology</strong> with the timeless creativity of Middle Eastern artists.
          By establishing transparent NFT marketplaces for each country under one unified blockchain ecosystem, we aim to support artists,
          preserve cultural identity, and create a self-sustaining economic network that reflects both authenticity and innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>i2165062</strong> stands as a statement: The Middle East is not a story of conflict — it is a story of creation,
          connection, and infinite imagination.

    <!-- Slide 2 — mission & cultural scope -->
    <section class="slide" aria-roledescription="slide" aria-label="Cultural Mission">
      <h1 class="intro-title">Culture First. People First.</h1>
      <p class="intro-subtitle">A living archive of identity: heritage, sound, language, and memory</p>

      <div class="intro-text">
        <p>
          <strong>i2165062</strong> documents the real face of the Middle East through the lens of its people.
          Each country page explores <strong>culture, national identity, and heritage</strong>: ancient sites, museums,
          architectural schools, artisan crafts, and everyday design.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also map <strong>music traditions, dialects, and historical forms of governance</strong> across periods —
          not to judge, but to understand the social fabric that shaped creativity. This is a curated space where
          <em>artists, historians, musicians, and storytellers</em> coexist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built on a unified blockchain backbone, our goal is to launch <strong>country-specific NFT markets</strong> where
          verified creators can publish their work — visual art, music, photography, calligraphy, crafts — and reach a global
          audience <strong>directly, without middlemen</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result: fair income for artists, authentic discovery for collectors, and a preserved cultural record for the world.
